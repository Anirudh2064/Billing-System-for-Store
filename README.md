# Billing-System-for-Store
Introduction:

The project Billing system is all about making the process of billing of the items
ordered by the customers easier.This system can be used by the employees
working at the store, so that they can make all the billing calculations without
effort. It also stores the data about the customer and the items they bought.

Why do we need to develop it?

Today, all services are available online and the time factor along with accuracy
is the most important thing to be considered in any of the streams. If we are
doing bills manually it would take at least 3-5 minutes and it would not look
very neat and the storage of those bills would occupy a lot of space. So, we need
a billing system in order to decrease the time duration and increase the
efficiency in storing the data.

How does it work?

My project consists of a simple swing GUI which enables a shop consisting of
various gaming and streaming setup to create a bill for the things customers buy
. It also enables them to print the bill via connecting to various printers and it
can also be saved as a pdf for future purposes.It also consists of a reset option
which resets the whole process if they are not interested at the last moment.
There is also a total button which will display the bill and show tax , total and
subtotal of items customers chose and an exit button. There would be a list of
items which are essential for streaming and gaming that customers can choose
from.

● In order to implement this project I used swing.

Java swing was introduced in 1997. It is built on the foundation of the AWT.

➢ It has two key features :

1. Lightweight component : swing components are written entirely in java
and do not map directly to platform specific peers.

2. A pluggable look and feel – each swing component is rendered by java
code rather by native peers; the look and feel of the component is under
control of swing.

I used the following swing components in the project I developed.

JFrame: It is an extended version of java.awt frame that adds support for the
swing component architecture.

Jpanel: The JPanel is the simplest container class. It provides space in which an
application can attach any other component. It inherits the JComponents class.

JButton: The JButton class is used to create a labelled button that has platform
independent implementation. The application results in some action when the
button is pushed. It inherits the AbstractButton class.

JLabel: It is a display area for a short text string or an image or both.

JTextfield: It is a lightweight component which allows the editing of a single
line or text.

JCheckBox: It is a part of the Java Swing package . JCheckBox can be selected
or deselected . It displays its state to the user . JCheckBox is an implementation
of checkbox . JCheckBox inherits the JToggleButton class.

JTextArea: It is a multi-line area that displays plain text. It is intended to be a
lightweight component that provides source compatibility with the java. awt.

Uses:

● It is used to reduce errors in calculation of bills.

● It will reduce the rush of customers at the billing counter.

● It is also easy for customers to buy items in a bulk without taking a lot of
time
